# Code Refactor Starter Code

## Description

This is a code refractor project for the Horiseon website. The goal was to update the previous code to follow accesability standards. 

## Accomplishments

During the project, several tasks were successfully accomplished to enhance the codebase and improve overall readability and maintainability:

- Consolidated redundant classes for a more efficient structure.
- Replaced HTML elements with semantic equivalents, enhancing the document's semantic meaning.
- Added alt text to images for better accessibility and usability.
- Provided explanatory comments within the HTML document to enhance code understanding.
- Reorganized the CSS code to follow a logical structure for ease of maintenance.
- Introduced comments to clearly delineate each separation.
- Included a descriptive title for improved context and understanding.

## Installation

1. Upload the index.html file, license.txt, and the assets folder to the web server. The assets folder should include images and CSS files necessary for your website's design and functionality.
2. Ensure that the web server is properly configured to handle the uploaded files and directories.
3. Check that the index.html file is accessible from the root domain or the desired path.
4. Verify that the CSS files are linked correctly in the index.html file to ensure proper styling.
5. Confirm that the images in the assets folder are referenced correctly within the HTML and CSS files.
6. Once the deployment is complete, access website's URL to see it live on the web server.
